# PPG - Procedural Puzzle Generator

My abandoned bachelor's project experimenting with procedurally generating puzzles for video games.

## Disclaimer:

In the rare case of you thinking to use this anywhere near production: please don't.
This is pure experimental.

__This is the core repository. For extending projects please refer to these links:__

[ppg-yaml; YAML extension for the use with ppg-core](https://github.com/dAmihl/ppg-yaml)

[gdppg; A Godot module for ppg-yaml](https://github.com/dAmihl/gdppg)

## Examples:


I have also created a small game in Godot Engine using this system which can be found here: [simplePPG](https://github.com/dAmihl/simplePPG)

## Build:

* Install Premake5
* Run e.g. `premake5 vs2019`
